/*With absolute positioning, an element can be placed anywhere on a page.
left:  placed #px from the left of the page
right:  placed #px from the right of the page
top:  placed #px from the top of the page
bottom:  placed #px from the bottom of the page*/


/*For absolute position to be used it's always better to use relative for the parent's position*/
